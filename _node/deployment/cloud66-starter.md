## Cloud 66 Starter

Cloud 66 starter is an open-source command line tool to generate a _Dockerfile_ and a _service.yml_ file from arbitrary source code. The _service.yml_ file is a Cloud 66 service definition file which is used to define the service configurations on a stack.

Starter works in the same way as BuildPacks do, but only generates the above mentioned files; the image compile step happens on the [BuildGrid](http://help.cloud66.com/building-your-stack/introduction-to-docker-deployments). Starter does not require any additional third party tools or frameworks to work (it's compiled as a Go executable).


## Get Started

To get started [download the executable](http://app.cloud66.com/starter) and run it on your development machine.

```

$ cd /my/project
$ starter

```

This will analyze the project in the current folder and generate the two files: _Dockerfile_ and _service.yml_ in the same folder, prompting for information when required.

```

```

Starter supports Procfiles and generates a service in _service.yml_ for each item in the _Procfile_. It is strongly advised to use a _Procfile_ to define your own service commands, as starter will only detect the web service otherwise.

To use starter on a different folder, you can use the `p` option:

```

$ starter -p /my/project

```

For more options, please see:

```

$ starter --help 

```




### Supported Languages / Frameworks

- Ruby, Rack (Rails, Sinatra, Padrino)


## Contributing & Adding support for new frameworks and languages

We will be adding support for new languages and frameworks over the time. However, if you find yourself interested in adding one, it's fairly easy to do:

- Get the source code and compile it (it's written in Go!)
- Create a new directory under `packs/` for you language or framework, e.g `packs/java/`.
- You then need to implement two interfaces, `packs.Analyzer` and `packs.Detector`.
- The `Detector` tells starter if the project is written in the given language or framework (in this example Java)
- The `Analyzer` analyze the project and write the `Dockerfile` and `service.yml`.
- Create a template with the name of the language under the `templates/dockerfiles` folder, e.g `java.dockerfile.template`
- Use Golang template syntax to build the template for `Dockerfile`
