## Step 1. Build your stack

Before you can deploy your applications to a server with Cloud 66, you must build a stack of the web applications components your application needs to run. To build your first stack, complete the following steps.

1.  Sign in to Cloud 66.
2.  On the Cloud 66 dashboard, click _Get started building a **Node** stack_.



## Step 2. Access your Git repository

If you have a private Git repository, complete the following steps to generate the keys needed to access your repository. If you have a public Git repository, skip to Step 3.

1.  In the _Accessing Git_ dialog box, copy the SSH key, select your Git provider from the list, and click the associated _Go_ button.
2.  Add the copied key to your Git provider.
3.  Return to Cloud 66.



## Step 3: Define your application properties

Complete the following steps to define the properties Cloud 66 uses to identify your application.

**Prerequisites**  

You must know the URL for your Git repository and the associated Git branch. For instructions on retrieving the Git repo URL and how to format it for this procedure, refer to [Access a public Git repository](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/accessing-your-git-repository#public) or [Access a private Git repository](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/accessing-your-git-repository#private).

1.  In the _About your app_ dialog box, do the following actions:
*   In the _Your Git Repo URL_ box, enter the URL for your Git repository.
*   In the _Git branch_ box, type the branch name. This field defaults to the "master" branch.
*   In the _Give your stack a name_ box, type a name for your application stack.
*   In the _Environment_ list, select the environment to deploy.
2.  Click _Analyze_. Cloud 66 will analyze your application.



## Step 4: Review your app configuration

Cloud 66 analyzes your application and returns the configuration details it detects. Complete the following procedure to verify the application configuration is correct.

1.  In the _About your app_ dialog box, verify the returned information. If it is incorrect, make the necessary changes and click _Re-analyze my code_.



## Step 5: Define deployment properties

Complete the following steps to define the properties that determine how to deploy your application.

**Prerequisites**  

If deploying to a cloud server, you must know the API key for your cloud provider. If deploying to your server, you must have (or generate) a SSH key for the server. For instructions on generating an SSH key, refer to [Setting up SSH keys](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/setting-up-ssh-keys).

1.  In the _Where are you deploying to_ dialog box, select the deployment target to use.
2.  Perform one of the following actions, depending on your deployment configuration:
*   If deploying to a cloud, select the cloud provider, server region and server size.
*   If deploying to a server, enter your username and IP address.
3.  In the _Deployment details_ dialog box, select the database option to use.
4.  Click _Deploy_.



## Step 6: Review the deployment logs

After your application builds successfully, you can view the log generated by the deployment.



## What's next?

Your stack is up and running, and you can start customizing by:

*   [Scale your Node.js application](https://help.cloud66.works/node/deployment/scale-node.html)
*   [Configure security]({% if include.product == "skycap" %}https://help.cloud66.works/maestro/stack-management/network-configuration.html{% else %}https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/stack-management/network-configuration.html{% endif %})
*   [Configure an add-in](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/addins/add-in-implementation.html)
