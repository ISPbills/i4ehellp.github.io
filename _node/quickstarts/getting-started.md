<img src="/assets/node/node_about_app.png" alt="Fill in the information about your app: Git repo, name and environment">

* Git repo URL for your app &mdash; We support `http://`, `git://` or `git@` URL formats. Please note that **HTTPS isn't currently supported**.
* **What branch do you want to deploy** &mdash; This defaults to master but you can provide any branch you like.
* **Give your new application a name** &mdash; This is the name that will be used in the Cloud 66 Dashboard once your app is deployed.
* **Choose an Environment** &mdash; Choose the Environment that you're deploying to: Production, Development, QA, Staging or Production.

Now click the **Analyze** button. Hang tight, the results will be displayed in a few seconds...

## Configuring your application

Once the analysis is complete you'll see a yellow Information Box that you can use to verify the analysis is correct.

If there are any problems you can make changes and click *Reanalyze my code*. If necessary, you can also Add [Environment Variables](/node/tutorials/env-vars.html).

<div class="notice">
    <h3>Advanced Configurations</h3>

</div>

## Choosing a deployment target

If you're deploying for the first time you need to add your Cloud provider credentials:
