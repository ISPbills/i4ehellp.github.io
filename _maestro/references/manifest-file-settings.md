## Classes of manifest file settings

Although manifest files are a powerful tool for defining the composition of an application, it is vital to understand their limits and exceptions. 

There are three broad classes of settings in manifest files:

1. Settings that only apply when an application is deployed for the first time (e.g. how much RAM your server should have)
2. Settings that only apply after a specific action is taken (e.g. using Toolbelt to force Nginx to refresh its configuration)
3. Settings that apply each time an application is redeployed
