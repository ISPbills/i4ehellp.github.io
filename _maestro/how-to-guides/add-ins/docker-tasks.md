Maestro allows you to automate tasks for Docker at two different levels:
* Server host
* Service

These add-ins allow you to manage those tasks:

## Server host

{% include how-to-guides/add-ins/docker-server-task.md %}


## Docker service

{% include how-to-guides/add-ins/docker-service-task.md %}
