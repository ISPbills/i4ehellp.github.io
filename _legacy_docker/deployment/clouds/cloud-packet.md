## About using Packet cloud

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Packet](https://www.packet.net/).






## Adding your Packet credentials

Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select _Get started building a stack_. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select _Packet_ and provide your Packet API Key from _API Keys_ on your _Packet Dashboard_.









### Notice

Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers **will not** be deleted on your cloud provider unless [physical server deletion](/managing-your-stack/server-deletion) is turned on.
