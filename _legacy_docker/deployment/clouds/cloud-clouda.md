## About using Cloud-A cloud

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Cloud-A](https://www.clouda.ca/). Your servers and loadbalancer will be deployed in the _Default Network_ and will have public IP address from _Ext-Net_.  






## Adding your Cloud-A credentials

Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and select _Get started building a stack_. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to _Add your cloud platform_. From this menu, select _Cloud-A_ and provide use your Cloud-A username as _Username_ and your password as _API Key_.









### Notice

Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers **will not** be deleted on your cloud provider unless [physical server deletion](/managing-your-stack/server-deletion) is turned on.
