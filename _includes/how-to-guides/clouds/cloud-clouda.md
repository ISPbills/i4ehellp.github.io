<div class="notice notice-danger"><p>
Cloud 66 no longer supports the provisioning of new servers via Cloud-A. Existing applications will continue to be supported.
</p></div>

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in [Cloud-A](https://www.clouda.ca/). Your servers and load balancer will be deployed in the _Default Network_ and will have public IP address from _Ext-Net_.

## Adding your Cloud-A credentials

Visit the Cloud 66 Dashboard and click the green *New Application* button. After connecting to your Git repository and analyzing your code, you will be asked to *Add your cloud platform*. From this menu, select **Cloud-A** and provide your Cloud-A username as _Username_ and your password as _API Key_.
