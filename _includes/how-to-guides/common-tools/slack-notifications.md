## Overview

You can choose to receive notifications from your Cloud 66 account in your team's Slack workspace. To set up Slack notifications you need to connect Cloud 66 to your Slack account using the **Cloud 66 Slack App** which we have created in partnership with Slack. The app is hosted (and approved) by Slack.

## What does the Cloud 66 Slack App do?

The Cloud 66 Slack App does two things:

- It allows Cloud 66 to securely connect to your Slack workspace (with your permission)
- It allows Cloud 66 to push notifications to the Slack channel(s) you define in your Cloud 66 account settings

## Installing the Cloud 66 Slack App

The simplest way to add the app to your Slack account is to click the "Add to Slack" button below. You need to be signed into your Slack account on your default browser in order for this to work correctly. If you have multiple Slack workspaces, be careful to add the Cloud 66 app to the correct workspace.

If you're more comfortable installing directly via the Slack interface, you can do so by: 

- Logging into your workspace
- Visiting the app's page in the Slack App directory (you can also search "Cloud 66" from the directory homepage)
- Clicking the **Add to Slack** button on that page

In either case you will need to step through the standard Slack approval process to confirm that you want to add the app to your Slack account and grant it the permissions it requires to function. 

## Removing the Cloud 66 Slack App

If you need to remove the Cloud 66 App from your Slack account for any reason, you can do so by:

- Logging into your workspace
- Clicking **Menu** and then **Configure Apps**
- Clicking on the name of the App (Cloud 66)
- Clicking the **Disable** or **Remove** at the top of the Configuration page

If you have set up multiple configurations enabled under the App, you will need to deactivate and/or remove them one by one.
