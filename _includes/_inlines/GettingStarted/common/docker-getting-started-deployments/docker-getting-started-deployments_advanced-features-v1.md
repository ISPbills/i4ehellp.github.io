## Advanced Features

 Information that defines how your application is deployed is accessible from _manifest.yml_. You can edit this file directly if you need to access [advanced deployment features](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/deployment/getting-started-with-manifest-files.html). For example advanced configuration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud and more.
