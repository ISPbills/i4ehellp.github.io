## Private repositories

For Cloud 66 to access your private repository (with read-only access), you first need to add the SSH provided to your account, You can find it by going to _Account_ --> _Keys & External Services_ --> _Source Code Git Key_.

You can add this SSH key globally to your Git account by adding it to your _Account settings_ page, or allow access to a specific repository by adding it as a _Deploy key_ to that repository.

Once this is done, use a Git URL in the following format:

`git@<git provider>:<username>/<repository>.git`

This URL is often generated by your Git provider automatically.
