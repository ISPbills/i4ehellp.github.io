## Configuring Services

In the example below we have a single Rails service. In this case it's been pulled from an image. The previous section of this guide explains how to [add and build images for your services](docker-getting-started-building-your-images#building-images).

The Rails service is a web application so we need to configure it to handle web traffic.
