## What is a backup verifier?

A backup verifier is a great way to ensure that your backups actually contain the data you expect. You simply provide a query that you expect to return a specific result, and we verify that your backup actually returns this value. This feature supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and requires the use of managed backups. Backup verification runs once every 6 hours for each stack, and you will be notified in the case of a failured verification.
