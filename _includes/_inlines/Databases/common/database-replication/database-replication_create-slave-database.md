## Create slave database

To add a slave database server you need to follow the below steps. To add multiple you need to scale up one by one.

1.   Set up a managed backup via  [add-ins](/toolbelt//stack-add-ins/add-in-implementation) if you don't have any.
2.   Go on your stack page, database servers page (eg. _PostgreSQL Servers_)
3.   On the right sidebar click on _SCALEUP DATABASE_ (the button will not be shown if you have not set up database backups)
