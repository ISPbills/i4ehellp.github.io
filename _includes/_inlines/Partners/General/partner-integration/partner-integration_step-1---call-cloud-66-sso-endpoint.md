### Step 1 - Call Cloud 66 SSO endpoint

First step is to redirect user to Cloud 66 to make sure they are logged in (or let them log in if they are not). Users should be redirectd to `https://app.cloud66.com/sso/signin/PROVIDER`. You need to replace `PROVIDER` with the your unique partner name which will be given to you after partner registration.
