#[Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-scope/) automatically generates a map of your application, enabling you to intuitively understand, monitor, and control your containerized, microservices based application. Perfect for visualisation of your Docker stack and debug purposes.

Weave Scope is installed using [deploy hooks](http://help.cloud66.com/deployment/deploy-hooks) and the weave_scope [snippet](https://github.com/cloud66/snippets/blob/master/cloud66/weave_scope).
