### Build root

Specifies the directory of your repository in which you wish to run your Docker build. You can also specify a [Dockerfile path](/building-your-stack/building-your-docker-service#dockerfile_path), which will be the Dockerfile used when building your service which is a relative value to this one.



{%include _inlines/building-your-service/code_building-your-service_build-root-rvices.md %}



This will default to the _root folder_ of your repository if not specified.
