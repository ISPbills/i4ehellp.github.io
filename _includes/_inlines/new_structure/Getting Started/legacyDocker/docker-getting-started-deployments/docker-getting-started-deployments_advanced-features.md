    Advanced Features

    Information that defines how your application is deployed is accessible from _manifest.yml_. You can edit this file directly if you need to access [advanced deployment features](http://help.cloud66.com/building-your-stack/getting-started-with-manifest-files). For example advanced configuration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud and more.
