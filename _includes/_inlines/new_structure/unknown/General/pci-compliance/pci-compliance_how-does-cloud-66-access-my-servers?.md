### How does Cloud 66 access my servers?
We access your servers using Secure Shell (SSH) protocol and SSH private/public keys. The keys generated by Cloud 66 to connect to your servers are 2048-bit RSA keys. The keys are either generated by your cloud vendor or Cloud 66 depending on different vendors.

We also generate a key for you through a script when using our Cloud 66 Registered Server product.

Our connection to your servers is done only through a set of [pre-announced IP addresses](/introduction-to-cloud-66/security-summary).
