To add a role, access your _Account_ page and select the _Organizations & Team_ menu.

Next, click the _+_ button in the top right corner of _Roles_ section. This will allow you to choose a role name. Then you click on the permission tab chosse the role you just made and set the permissions by ticking the check boxes to give permissions.
