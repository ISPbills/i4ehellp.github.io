## Add a team member

To invite your team members, access your _Account_ page and select the _Organizations & Team_ menu.

You need to give your team a name before inviting other members. This is the same as your _Company name_ on the _Payments_ page. If you already have entered a company name, you will skip this part.

Next, click into the _Team_ tab, and click the _+_ button in the top right corner. This will allow you to choose a user type (Stack or Finance user), input an email address and set the users permissions and its default role for stacks.

Upon confirmation, an email will be sent to the email address specified, giving this user the option to sign up for Cloud 66 with their specified email address. If the invited email already has a Cloud 66 account, they will be notified of the pending invitation. By accepting the invitation, they will join your team.
