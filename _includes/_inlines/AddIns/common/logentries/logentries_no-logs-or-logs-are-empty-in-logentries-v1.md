### No Logs or Logs are empty in Logentries

If your log files (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">make sure they exist on the server</span>) are not showing up in your Logentries account or they are empty, try to **SCAN FOR NEW LOGS**. In order to do that you will need to:

- Go to your log analyzer config page (click on logentries in your stack page under External add-ins).
- Push the SCAN FOR NEW LOGS button.
