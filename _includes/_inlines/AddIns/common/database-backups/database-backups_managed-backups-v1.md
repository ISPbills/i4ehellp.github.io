#### Managed backups

Having managed backups carries several benefits:

- You can download database backups through the web UI and API
- [Backup verifiers](https://help.cloud66.works/rails/databases/backup-verifiers.html) ensure that your backups actually contain what you expect
- Use [database replication](https://help.cloud66.works/{{include.product}}/databases/database-replication.html) to scale your databases
- You can easily restore database backups
- Stored in Cloud 66 storage

The 100 most recent managed backups are kept by default.
