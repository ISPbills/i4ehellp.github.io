## Overview
Your [data, infrastructure and code security](/introduction-to-cloud-66/security-summary) is of utmost importance to us. We continuously monitor and audit our entire system for security and invite all security experts to share their concerns and options with us regarding Cloud 66 security and how we can do better.

With the ultimate goal of protecting your infrastructure, data and code we can't stop at securing Cloud 66 itself. If your Cloud 66 account is compromised because of a shared password or a stolen computer you are still in danger and we certainly don't want that.

That's why we have Cloud 66 Account Protection.
