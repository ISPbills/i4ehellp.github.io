## Account Protection Alerts
Once an account activity anomaly is detected an email is sent to the main account owner's registered email address. At this point the account owner has 2 options:

1. Accept the alert as a known behavior and improve Account Protection's algorithm.
2. Raise it as a possible security breach.

If an alert is raised as a breach, all of the users within that account will be logged out and blocked from accessing the account, including the main account owner's account. At this point you will need to contact [Cloud 66 Support](mailto:support@cloud66.com) and we will work with you to review the situation and will unlock your account when you are comfortable with it.
