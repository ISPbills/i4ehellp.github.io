## Add a recovery phone number

We strongly suggest that you add your phone number on the _Account_ page to recover your account should you at some point not be able to access your verification codes on your phone.

If you haven't added your phone number and are locked out, please [contact support](mailto:support@cloud66.com) from the email address you are registered with and we'll take you through a security procedure.
