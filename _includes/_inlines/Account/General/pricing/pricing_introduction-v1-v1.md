## Introduction

Our pricing is simple - you only pay for what you use, and there are no setup fees or fixed term contracts.

The billing cycle for your account is every 30 days, and your account charges are calculated on an hourly basis.
Your account will be charged for the accumulated amount you've accrued during the last 30 days at the end of each cycle.

The first server in your account is charged at $19 per month, with additional servers up to 50 costing $12 per month.
