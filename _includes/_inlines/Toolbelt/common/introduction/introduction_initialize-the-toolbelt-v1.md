## Initialize the toolbelt

Before using the toolbelt, you need to link it to your Cloud 66 account. You can do this by issuing one of the available commands, which will return a URL that you need to copy and paste into your browser.

{%include _inlines/Toolbelt/common/introduction/code_introduction_initialize-the-toolbelt-cxstackslis-v1.md  product = include.product %}

Following this URL will redirect you to your account (you need to be logged in) and ask for your authorization to allow the toolbelt to view, edit, redeploy and administrate your stacks and servers.
