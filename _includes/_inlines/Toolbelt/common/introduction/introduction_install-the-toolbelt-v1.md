## Install the toolbelt?

To get started, simply download the [toolbelt executable](https://app.cloud66.com/toolbelt), unzip and copy it to a directory accessible in your PATH. On Mac OS X, your PATH is likely `/usr/local/bin`, but you can run `echo $PATH` in your terminal to determine your specific path. Placing the executable in this folder allows it to be used globally.
