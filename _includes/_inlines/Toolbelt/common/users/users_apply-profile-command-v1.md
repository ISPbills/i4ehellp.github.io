## Apply Profile command

Apply Profile allows you to apply a user's Access Profile to another one. To use this command you need to have an Access Profile as a `json` file. This can be generated using the `users show` command with the `json` option. Once you have the file you can modify it to make any changes you require in the Access Profile.
