## User integration API

This API is used to add a partner's service to the user's account automatically.

An example of this is the addition of a new cloud vendor to a user's Cloud 66 account without user's manual intervention.

User integration API has three steps:

1. Redirect from Cloud 66 website to Partner website
2. Provisioning of service on the partner side and addition to user's account.
3. Redirect from partner's website to Cloud 66 website.
