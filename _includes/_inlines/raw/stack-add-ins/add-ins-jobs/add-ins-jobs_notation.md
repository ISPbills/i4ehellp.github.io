### Notation

Jobs use a facility in the shell called _positional parameters_. Positional parameters are a series of special variables ($1, $2 ... $n) that contain the contents of the command line. Where **n** is greater than 9 using braces. For example, to refer to the 15th positional parameter, use the notation `${15}`.
