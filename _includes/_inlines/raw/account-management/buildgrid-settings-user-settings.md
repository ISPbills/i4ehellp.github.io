### User Settings

Here you will see your username and password. Note that these are specific to your user, not this account. You can use these credentials to login to the Cloud 66 Private Registry and pull down your images (should you wish to use them somewhere other than your stack servers)
To use your BuildGrid username and password you can do the following:



{%include _inlines/path_to_code %}
