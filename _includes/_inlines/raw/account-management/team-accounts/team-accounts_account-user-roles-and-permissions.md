## Account user roles and permissions

The account administrator is the only user who can invite other members and change access rights for these members (unless this privilege is granted to another user). There are two types of users - _Finance users_ and _Stack users_.

Finance users only have access to your _Payment_ page, and can change billing information. They will receive payment notifications (successful and unsuccessful payments), but have no access rights to stacks. We do not charge for Finance users.

Stack users have access rights to stacks and different part of the organization under Cloud 66. You can specify the exact access rights you would like to grant to per stack by choosing a role for them (you can define a customized role). The available roles for stack users are:

- No role
- Viewer
- Deployer
- Developer
- Operation
- Power user
- Administrator

By definition, any user with access to a stack will automatically be given the rights for the lower levels of permissions. For example, a user who can control a stack will also be able to deploy and view that same stack. You can even customize these pre-defined roles, however, we recommend adding a role for custom permissions.

You also have the option of allowing team members to create a new stack and etc. The creator of a stack becomes its default stack administrator, although this setting can be changed by the team leader. In addition to this, you can also allow a user to control permissions for others.
