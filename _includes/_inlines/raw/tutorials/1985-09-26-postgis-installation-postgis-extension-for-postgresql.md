#### PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL
Spatially enabling a database using extensions is a new feature of PostgreSQL 9.1.

Connect to your database using pgAdmin or psql, and run the following commands. To add PostGIS with raster support:



{%include _inlines/path_to_code %}



To add topology support, a second extension can be created on the database:



{%include _inlines/path_to_code %}
