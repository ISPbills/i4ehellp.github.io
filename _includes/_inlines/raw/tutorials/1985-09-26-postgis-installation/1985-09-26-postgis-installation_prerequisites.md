### Prerequisites
A number of prerequisites are needed, which can either be built from source or installed from pre-built packages, as shown below.

Install packages using:



{%include _inlines/1985-09-26-postgis-installation/code_1985-09-26-postgis-installation_prerequisites-sudoaptg.md %}



Optional package for raster support (this is required if you want to build the PostgreSQL extensions):



{%include _inlines/1985-09-26-postgis-installation/code_1985-09-26-postgis-installation_prerequisites-sudoaptg.md %}
