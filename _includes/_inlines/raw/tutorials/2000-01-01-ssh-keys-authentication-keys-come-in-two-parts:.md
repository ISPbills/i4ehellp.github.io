#Authentication keys come in two parts:

1.

			**Public Key** &mdash; stored in the 
~/.ssh/authorized&#95;keys
 file of the server that you want to access.

2.

			**Private Key** &mdash; stored on your machine in the 
~/.ssh/
 directory. This allows you to gain access to any machine with the public key.
