### Asset Pipeline Compilation

If you haven't compiled assets locally, Heroku will attempt to run the assets:precompile task during slug compilation. Cloud 66 allows you to [specify whether or not to run this](http://help.cloud66.com/building-your-stack/asset-pipeline-compilation) during deployment.
