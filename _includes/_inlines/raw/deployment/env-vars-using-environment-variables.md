## Using environment variables

Using environment variables is done differently depending on your application settings, but these are some examples.

- **Bash scripts**



{%include _inlines/path_to_code %}



- **.YML files**  



{%include _inlines/path_to_code %}



- **.RB files**  



{%include _inlines/path_to_code %}
