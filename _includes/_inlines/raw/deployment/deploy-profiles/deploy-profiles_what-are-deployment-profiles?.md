## What are deployment profiles?

Deploy profiles enable you to deploy without having to set the settings each time you need to deploy. Cloud 66 has devided the deploy process in to two separate operations, Build and Publish. The build operation builds the code into a docker image, publish is when the built image is pushed to servers. With deploy profiles you can save different profiles to have different operations on different services, including the way they need to be deployed.
