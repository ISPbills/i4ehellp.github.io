## Using your management certificate

Access _Management portal_ of your Azure account and go to the _Settings_ menu. You will need the _Subscription ID_ which is listed in _Subscriptions_ tab. Select the _Management certificate_ tab and click the _Upload_ button to upload `azure.cer`.

Now visit your Cloud 66 dashboard and [build your first stack](http://help.cloud66.com/introduction-to-cloud-66/introduction-to-cloud-66). When adding your Azure credentials, you will be asked to input your _subscription ID_ and upload the `azure.pem` file you created earlier.
