### Cloud 66 Toolbelt

You can run the command below to register your servers using the [toolbelt](http://help.cloud66.com/toolbelt/toolbelt-introduction):

To register a single server, use the `server` flag with the IP address, and to bulk register, provide a text file with the `file` flag with one IP address per line.

To add tags to the registered servers, use the `tags` option:
