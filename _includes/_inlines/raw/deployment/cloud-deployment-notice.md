### Notice

Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers **will not** be deleted on your cloud provider unless [physical server deletion](/managing-your-stack/server-deletion) is turned on.




If you don't want to use a cloud provider with Cloud 66, you can [deploy to your own server](/deployment/registered-servers).
