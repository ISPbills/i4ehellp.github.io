### Reserved instances

[AWS reserved instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/) enable users of EC2 or RDS to reserve instances for one to three years, which has pricing benefits when compared to on-demand instances.

It's very simple to use Cloud 66 with AWS reserved instances: start by reserving an instance with your size/region requirements. Now, simply use Cloud 66 to deploy to a server of that size in the same region, and we'll use your reserved instance.
