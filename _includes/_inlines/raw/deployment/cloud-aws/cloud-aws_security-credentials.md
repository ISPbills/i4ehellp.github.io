### Security credentials

After selecting the _Security Credentials_ option, select the _Access Keys_ option from the menu. Now click _Create new access key_, and either download the key file or click _Show access key_ and take note of your _access key ID_ and _secret access key_. These are the credentials needed for Cloud 66 to access your account.
