## Update the toolbelt

Toolbelt updates are released periodically to improve the functionality available through the command line, and these are normally applied automatically in the background. Whenever a command is executed, the toolbelt will check whether or not a newer version is available and do a silent update. You can also update manually with `cx update`.

If you install the toolbelt in a shared folder, you may need to elevate your permissions in order to run an update. In this case, you can simply run `sudo cx update`. You can then check which verison you are using by running `cx -v`.
