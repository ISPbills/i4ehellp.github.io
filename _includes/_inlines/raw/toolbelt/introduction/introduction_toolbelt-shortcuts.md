## Toolbelt shortcuts

**Stack links**

To make life easier for you, the Cloud 66 toolbelt **detects the Git URL and branch for each directory it is run in**. As such, you won't have to specify which stack you want to run the toolbelt on if you're in the git folder and branch of one of your stacks.

**Naming shortcuts**

We apply naming shortcuts to both stack and server names, as well as server roles in the toolbelt.

We just need you to type enough of a name for it to be unique. For example, if you only have one stack that starts with _m_, you can simply type _m_.
Similarly, if you only have one web server, you can type _w_ instead of _web_.

**Auto-complete**

Follow our [instructions](https://github.com/cloud66/cx/wiki/Setting-up-Auto-complete-for-the-toolbelt) to add an auto-complete feature to your toolbelt, which will make typing commands out by hand much quicker.
