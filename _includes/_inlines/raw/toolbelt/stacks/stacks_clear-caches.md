## Clear caches

For improved performance, volatile code caches exist for your stack. It is possible for a those volatile caches to become invalid if you switch branches, change git repository URL, or rebase or force a commit. Since switching branch or changing git repository URL is done via the Cloud 66 interface, your volatile caches will automatically be purged. However, rebasing or forcing a commit doesn't have any association with Cloud 66, so this command can be used to purge the exising volatile caches.
