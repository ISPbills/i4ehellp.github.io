## About custom web servers

By default, stacks deployed by Cloud 66 run on [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) behind [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main). You can also choose to use one of several servers:

- [Passenger Enterprise](/web-server/passenger-enterprise)
- [Puma](/web-server/puma-rack-server)
- [Unicorn](/web-server/unicorn-rack-server)
- [Thin](/web-server/thin-rack-server)
