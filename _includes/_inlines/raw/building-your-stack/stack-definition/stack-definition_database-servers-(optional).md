### Database servers (optional)

You can choose between any of four supported databases:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Redis

Cloud 66 makes it easy for you to [backup your database](/database-management/database-backup), [verify the backup](/database-management/backup-verification) and [replicate your databases](/database-management/database-replication).
