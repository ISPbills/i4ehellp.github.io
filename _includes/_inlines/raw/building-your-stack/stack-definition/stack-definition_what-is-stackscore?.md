## What is StackScore?

StackScore&trade; is a score that provides an indication of how reliable, resilient and performant your application is when deployed on your servers. It consists of five key metrics that are graded from **A** to **F**, and the overall StackScore is the lowest of the scores across these five metrics.

- **Code:** Ensures your code does not have security issues by checking for known vulnerabilities.
- **Backups and data integrity:** This tracks whether or not you are backing up your databases (with managed and/or unmanaged backups), and whether or not you verify your backups.
- **Connectivity:** Checks whether or not you are sharing your frontend and backend on the same server. This is affected by how much memory you have on your servers, among other factors.
- **Performance:** Checks if you have a load balancer, as well as different server configuration metrics.
- **Security:** Tracks your firewall settings for potential security issues.
