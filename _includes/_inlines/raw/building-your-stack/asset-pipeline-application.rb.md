### Application.rb

Asset Pipeline precompilation will be disabled if `config.assets.enabled` variable is assigned to *false* in your `application.rb` file:



{%include _inlines/path_to_code %}



    
Setting this value to false means that your application doesn't use the asset pipeline at all, so precompilation is not relevant
.
