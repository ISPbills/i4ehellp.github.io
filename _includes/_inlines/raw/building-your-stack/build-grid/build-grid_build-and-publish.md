## Build and Publish

Cloud 66 for Docker Deployments consist of 2 steps: Build and Publish. Build step involves BuildGrid to build the required Docker images from your code. Publish is a step that rolls out the built images (or the ones pre-built by you) onto your servers.

You can choose to run each of these steps separately through the BuildGrid UI or command line.
