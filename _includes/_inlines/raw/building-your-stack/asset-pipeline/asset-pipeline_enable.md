## Enable/disable asset pipeline compilation

You can enable/disable asset pipeline precompilation for Rails stacks after the analysis step of your stack creation, or in your manifest file.

The asset pipeline compilation option will be hidden if you have enabled/disabled asset pipeline compilation in your application.rb or in the manifest file.
