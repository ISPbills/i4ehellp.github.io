### What's next?

Your stack is up and running - you now have:

- Docker servers with automated deployment and lifecycle management
- Networking and DNS layer across your stack
- Database layer
- Load balancing layer
- All other Cloud 66 features, such as security, managed Nginx, team management and so on.

*   [Scaling your servers](/managing-your-stack/scaling)
*   [Configuring security](/managing-your-stack/stack-network-settings)
*   [Configuring an add-in](/stack-add-ins/add-in-implementation)
