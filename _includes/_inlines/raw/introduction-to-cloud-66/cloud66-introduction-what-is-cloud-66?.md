## What is Cloud 66?

Cloud 66 builds your full stack on either your own servers or cloud servers, deploys your application to them, and manages it for you.
Whether you are a running a small hobby project or work in a large team of developers, Cloud 66 helps you focus on what you do best.

Because Cloud 66 is provided as a service, you don't need to install anything on your local machine. Some of the features we provide include:

*   **Deploying** your application to your cloud or your own servers
*   **Backing up** your databases at set intervals
*   **Scaling** your web, database, and process servers with the click of a button
*   **Securing** your servers with features such as intruder detection and firewall
*   **Monitoring** your servers

To get started, you just have to provide us with a Git URL to your repository or your own Docker image(s). We'll then build a stack based on it.

Before you get get started, you may want to look at our [Technical specifications](/introduction-to-cloud-66/technical-specifications) to determine if you're ready for Cloud 66.
