### Step 2: Service configuration

Now provide a stack name, and the environment you would like to deploy in. Next up is configuring your Docker services - for example _web_, _api_, _worker_ and so on. You can add as many services to your stack as you need. These are the available fields (for the _basic_ tab):

1.  What's the service name?
2.  How shall we build this service?
3.  Is the service accessible from the Internet? If so, specify which port your container runs on.
4.  Which database(s) do you need?

This page has _basic_ and _advanced_ configurations, designated by the tabs at the top of the form. Switching between the tabs will retain any previous information provided. The advanced tab allows you to input more detailed settings, which you can learn about in [Docker service configuration](/building-your-stack/docker-service-configuration).
