## How does LiveLogs work?

When you check one of the live log sources, we will automatically start listening to that source, and stream the output to your view. By default, the logs will be populated with the last 100 lines of the log (approximately). When you click on a log source, it sends logs for up to 10 minutes and then will automatically stop. The logs are ephemeral, meaning that they will disappear from the UI once you navigate to a different page or refresh.
