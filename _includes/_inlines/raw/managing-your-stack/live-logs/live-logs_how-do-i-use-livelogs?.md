## How do I use LiveLogs?

You can select to view a log file by selecting it from the right menu, and all of the checked log sources will be appended to the central log UI in the order that they arrive. To make it easier for you to navigate the logs, we provide an easy way for you to zoom in on the log entries that happen around any given line (by clicking the source on the left side of the log line). The log title on each row is in the same color as the log source menu item, and as each log line comes in, the corresponding log source indicator will flash. This should help you to see which sources are sending data at a glance.

Note that log sources that are not checked will not have any log sources streamed in (and will therefore not flash). Simply clicking on the title of that log line will open a context of several previous and next lines **from the same log source**. You can search further backwards or forwards within this context by clicking the *previous context* or *next context* links. If you were to uncheck a previously checked source, the corresponding logs for that item will also be removed from the UI.

In terms of the filtering, this occurs dynamically over your logs, and you can filter the results down to only those that match your search term, or clear the filter at any time. Logs will still be streamed, but you'll only see new logs matching your filter until it's cleared.

If you have a lot of log volume coming in, you can autoscroll to remain on the tail of your logs, alternatively you can temporarily pause your log sources by clicking on the _pause_ button. You can additionally clear existing logs from the UI with the _clear logs_ button.
