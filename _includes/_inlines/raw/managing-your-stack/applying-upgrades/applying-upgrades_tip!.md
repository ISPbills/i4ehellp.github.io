### Tip!

It is best to keep your Docker and Weave versions up to date as they are released quite frequently with bug/security fixes 



1. Update your manifest file (Configuration Files -> Manifest.yml) and change the Docker and Weave version to the [latest ones](/introduction-to-cloud-66/technical-specifications#versions).

2. Click on **DEPLOY** and choose **Deploy with options**

3. Go to the **More options** tab and tick the **Apply Docker upgrades** check box.
