## Configure network traffic

By default, all traffic is allowed to visit your web servers on ports 80, 443, 8080 and 8443. The _Traffic_ tab allows you to control this, and has two sections: _allowed_ traffic sources and _denied_ traffic sources.

For each of these fields, you can enter a single IP address, a comma-separated list, or range. For example:



{%include _inlines/network-configuration/code_network-configuration_configure-network-traffic-.md %}
