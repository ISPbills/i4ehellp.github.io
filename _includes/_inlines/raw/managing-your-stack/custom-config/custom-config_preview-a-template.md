## Preview a template

To use Nginx as an example, go to your Web Servers group detail page and click _CONFIGURE NGINX_ in the right sidebar. This page will show you the template used to build the Nginx configuration when Nginx is deployed during your stack built or reconfigured. Once you're done with editing your template, you can preview the results by clicking on the _Preview_ button.

See our documentation for more details about CustomConfig for [Nginx](/web-server/nginx), [HAProxy](/web-server/haproxy) and [databases](/database-management/database-management).
