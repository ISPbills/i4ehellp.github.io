#### Uploading your SSH public key

Like any other git repository, CustomConfig git requires a public SSH key for authentication. If you are not familiar with how git SSH key authentication works or how to generate your own SSH keys, you can read this great guide by Github: [Git SSH key setup(https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

You can upload your public SSH key at **Account / Keys / Public Key** when logged into your Cloud 66 account.
