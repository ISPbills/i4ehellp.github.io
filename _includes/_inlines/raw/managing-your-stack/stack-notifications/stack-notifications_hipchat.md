### Hipchat

[Hipchat](http://hipchat.com/) is a hosted realtime chat service by Atlassian, and you can link your account to Cloud 66 to receive notifications on Hipchat.

From the Hipchat _Account settings_ menu, click _API access_, and then the link for _API version 1_. Once on the API v1 page, create an API token. By selecting the Hipchat icon on the _Stack notifications_ page, you can add this token and select which room you would like your notifications to appear in.
