            **I'm using a GitHub Repo** &mdash;
            This is the easiest way to add services from GitHub repos. You will need to link your GitHub account with Cloud 66 before you can take advantage of this. You can do this by clicking the _Lets link with GitHub now_ link that will appear if you haven't signed up to Cloud 66 with GitHub.

*

            **I'm using a manual Git Repo** &mdash;
            Use this option if you have a private git repo or you're using another git provider such as BitBucket. You can also choose this if you don't want to link Cloud 66 to your GitHub account. You will need to [add and approve the Cloud 66 public key](https://help.cloud66.com/getting-started/git-repository) if your repo is private. You'll be prompted to do this if required.

*

            **It's a Docker Image** &mdash;
        Use this to add pre-built images to a project. You can use a service like DockerHub or your own private image repo. If you're using a private repository you'll be prompted to add the necessary login credentials.

    Once you've finished adding services click Start Build.
