## Using one-time database imports

On your stack detail page, visit your database server group (eg. _MySQL server_) and click the name of your main database server. In the right sidebar, click _Database Import_, which will display a list of available _source_ stacks.

Select the stack you want to use as a _source_ and click _Import_, which will start the data import from your _source_ to the _target_.
