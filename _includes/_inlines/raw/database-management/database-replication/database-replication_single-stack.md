### Single stack

To enable replication on a single stack, visit your stack detail page, click on the database server group (eg. _PostgreSQL server_) and click _Scale Up_ in the top right corner. This will allow you to choose your new server size. Your new server should contain at least two times more disk space than the size of your database backup, and we recommend that it is comparable to your master server (in terms of memory).
