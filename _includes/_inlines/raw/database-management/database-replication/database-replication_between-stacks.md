### Between stacks

To enable replication between stacks, ensure that you have a secondary stack deployed, and that its database server contains at least two times more disk space than the size of your database backup. Visit your stack detail page, click on the database server group (eg. _PostgreSQL server_) click into your main database server page. Next, click _Configure data replication_ in the right sidebar, and select a source stack. Confirm to commence the replication process.
