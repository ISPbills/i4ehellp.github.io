## How can I use Cloud 66?

[Sign up](http://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_up) for an account and start by building your first stack. Specify a Git repository that contains a Dockerfile, or provide your own Docker image(s) to base your stack on. A few seconds later you can configure your app deployment and point your stack to the servers you would like to run your app on.
