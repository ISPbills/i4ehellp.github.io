## About manual upgrades

If you need to upgrade any part of your stack the best course of action is always to build a new one. However, if that is not desired or possible, you can always perform manual upgrades.

We detect the version of all the components we have configured or deployed on your servers on a regular basis and after each deployment. If you upgrade any part of your stack manually, the upgrade will be detected by Cloud 66. This helps with the future automated upgrades.
