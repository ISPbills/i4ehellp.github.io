### Background processes

Logs for background processes can also be found in `$STACK_PATH/log`, and depend on the name of the process:

*   Process log: 

{%include _inlines/StackManagement/common/logging/code_logging_background-processes-log-v1.md  product = include.product %}




*   Process bluepill log: 

{%include _inlines/StackManagement/common/logging/code_logging_background-processes-log-2-v1.md  product = include.product %}
