### Allowing traffic

Repeated visits within a short time period on the ports mentioned above (more than 1,500 hits per minute from a single IP address) are blocked by ActiveProtect. By allowing traffic for a specific IP address or range, this limit is ignored. You can also choose not to block traffic coming from Cloudflare edge servers.
