## What is LiveLogs?

Live logs allow you to stream logs from your server, including Docker services and host logs.  You can add log sources from the right hand side menu, via the groups or individual checkboxes, and for Docker stacks you can select these based on service too. This feature is intended as a live monitoring and debugging tool - to view historic logs you would still need to look at your servers manually or use a traditional logging provider.
