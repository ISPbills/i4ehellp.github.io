## Accessing CustomConfig

You can access and modify CustomConfig files in two different ways:

1. Using the web based UI
2. Using CustomConfig git repository

Using the web based UI is very easy. Everything you need to use the web based UI is on this page.

**CustomConfig git** is a private git repository that allows you make changes to CustomConfig files using the well known git tooling. You can find more information about [CustomConfig git repository here](/managing-your-stack/customconfig-git).
