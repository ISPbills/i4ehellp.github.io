## What is CustomConfig?

CustomConfig allows you to edit and modify component configuration templates used by Cloud 66 to configure your servers. This is currently available for Nginx, HAProxy and database configurations, and more configuration templates are forthcoming.

CustomConfig uses the [Liquid templating language](http://www.liquidmarkup.org/) developed by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/) and used by many websites. There are many good resources on the web on how to use the Liquid syntax.
