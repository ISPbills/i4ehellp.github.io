By default, Cloud66 will not delete servers and other objects created in your cloud after you delete the stack. However, you can change this setting.

If you go to the stack information page and select `Remove physical servers when a Cloud66 server is deleted?`, then when you delete a server, load balancer, or even a whole stack, related objects in the cloud will be deleted as well.
