## Basic Search

You can type and word or phrase in the search bar at the top of each page to start your search. By default this will search the following:

- Stacks
- Servers
- Services
- Containers
- Firewall Rules
- Environment Variables
- Deployments

All queries can be a full or partial string. So both `awesome` and `awes` will find all entities with `awesome` somewhere.
