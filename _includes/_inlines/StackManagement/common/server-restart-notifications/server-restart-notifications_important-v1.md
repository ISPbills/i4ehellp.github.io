### Important

Depending on your cloud provider, if you instead choose to shut your server down, then start it again via the cloud provider dashboard, you may have new IP addresses assigned to your server. That can take a little while to propagate to Cloud 66 and your DNS provider, meaning you may have some unnecessary downtime should you choose this restart method.
