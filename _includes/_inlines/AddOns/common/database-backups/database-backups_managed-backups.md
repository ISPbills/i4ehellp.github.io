#### Managed backups

Having managed backups carries several benefits:

- You can download database backups through the web UI and API
- [Backup verifiers](/database-management/backup-verification) ensure that your backups actually contain what you expect
- Use [database replication](/database-management/database-replication) to scale your databases
- You can easily restore database backups
- Stored in Cloud 66 storage

The 100 most recent managed backups are kept by default.
