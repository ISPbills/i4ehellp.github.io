#### Cloud 66 toolbelt

You can retrieve your database backup by using the [toolbelt backup management](/toolbelt/toolbelt-backup-management). Your backup may be bigger than 350 MB, in which case it will be divided into several files. By using the toolbelt, the files are downloaded and concatenated automatically for you.
