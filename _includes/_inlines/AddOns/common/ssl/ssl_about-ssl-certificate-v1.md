## About SSL Certificate

SSL is an acronym for Secure Sockets Layer, an encryption technology that was created by Netscape. SSL creates an encrypted connection between your web server and your visitors' web browser allowing for private information to be transmitted without the problems of eavesdropping, data tampering, or message forgery.

Cloud 66 provides two types of SSL, one is the standard one and the other is the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) one.
