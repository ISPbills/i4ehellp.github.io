## Change the HAProxy endpoint

By default, HAProxy will visit the _/_ endpoint on your application every 2 seconds to determine its state. This endpoint may need to change if that endpoint isn't available to the load balancer.

You will want to look at the _httpchk_ option to change the endpoint - the simplest solution is to create a low overhead non-auth HTTP route somewhere in your application.

For example, you could place a file called _check.html_ in your _/public_ folder, which would be served directly by Nginx (not your application). It would be available at _/check.html_.

In this case, you could replace the _httpchk_ section with this:

`httpchk HEAD /check.html HTTP/1.0`.
