### What is the custom server add-in?
Adding a custom server to your stack allows you to manage your own services while still benefiting from the Cloud 66 ecosystem.

A custom server will have the following Cloud 66 features enabled:

- [Monitoring](/managing-your-stack/server-monitoring)
- [Security](/managing-your-stack/stack-network-settings)
- Use of [Cloud 66 add-ins](/stack-add-ins/add-in-implementation)
- [Log rotation](/managing-your-stack/logging)
- [SSH to your server via toolbelt](/toolbelt/toolbelt-ssh-to-servers)
