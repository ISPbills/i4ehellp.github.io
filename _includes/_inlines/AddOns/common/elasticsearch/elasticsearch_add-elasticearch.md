## Add Elasticearch
To add Elasticsearch to your stack, access the add-ins menu, click _Elasticsearch_ and choose the size of your new server. This adds three environment variables to your stack: `ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS_INT`, `ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS_EXT` and `ELASTICSEARCH_ADDRESS`, which you can use to connect to your Elasticsearch instance.
