## Customer protection

All customer sensitive data including API keys, SSH keys and passwords are encrypted with a multi-network setup for the decryption mechanism.

We take a wide range of other measures to improve user's [stack security](/managing-your-stack/stack-network-settings) and help them improve their security by [upgrading their stacks](/managing-your-stack/applying-upgrades). Cloud 66 connects to user's servers only from `54.84.166.97` address and all provisioned servers are configured to only allow connections from this IP.

Additionally, customer source code is only kept for a limited period of time.
