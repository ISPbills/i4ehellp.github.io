### Step 3: Define deployment properties

Complete the following steps to define the properties that determine how to deploy your application.

**Prerequisites**  

If deploying to a cloud server, you must know the API key for your cloud provider. If deploying to your server, you must have (or generate) a SSH key for the server. For instructions on generating an SSH key, refer to [Setting up SSH keys](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/setting-up-ssh-keys).

1.  In the _Where are you deploying to_ dialog box, select the deployment target to use.
2.  Perform one of the following actions, depending on your deployment configuration:

*   If deploying to a cloud, select the cloud provider, server region and server size.
*   If deploying to a server, enter your username and IP address.
3.  In the _Deployment details_ dialog box, select the database option to use.
4.  Click _Deploy_.

This page also has _basic_ and _advanced_ configurations, designated by the tabs at the top of the form. Switching between the tabs will retain any previous information provided. The advanced tab allows you to input more detailed settings, which you can learn about in [Getting started with manifest files](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/deployment/getting-started-with-manifest-files.html).
