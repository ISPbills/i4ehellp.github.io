## What youâ€™ll need

*   [Cloud 66 account](https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_up)
	-  Pull your code from Git (with a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/))
	- Provide an existing Docker image   
  
  
  
* Deployment credentials

	-  The API key for your cloud provider ([Deploy to your cloud](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/deployment/clouds/))
  

Alternatively, if you don't want to use a cloud provider, you can use your own server ( [Deploy to a registered server](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/deployment/registered-servers.html) )
