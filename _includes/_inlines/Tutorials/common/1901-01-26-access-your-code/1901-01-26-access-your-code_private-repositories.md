## Private repositories

For Cloud 66 to access your private repository (with read-only access), you first need to add the SSH provided to your Git account. Follow the instructions on the _Get started building your stack_ page, clicking the _How?_ link.

You can add this SSH key globally to your GitHub account by adding it to your _Account settings_ page, or allow access to a specific repository by adding it as a _Deploy key_ to that repository.

Once this is done, use a Git URL in the following format:

`git@
:
/
.git`

This URL is often generated by your Git provider automatically.
