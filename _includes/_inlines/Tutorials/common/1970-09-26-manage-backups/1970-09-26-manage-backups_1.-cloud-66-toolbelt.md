### 1. Cloud 66 toolbelt
The best way to retrieve your database backup is by using the [toolbelt backup management](http://help.cloud66.com/toolbelt/toolbelt-backup-management). Your backup may be bigger than 250 MB, in which case it will be divided into several files. By using the toolbelt, the files are downloaded and concatenated automatically for you.
