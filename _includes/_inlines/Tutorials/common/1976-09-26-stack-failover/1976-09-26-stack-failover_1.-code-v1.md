[Clone your existing stack](http://help.cloud66.com/building-your-stack/stack-definition#stackscore#clone) to a different cloud vendor or data center, and set it into [maintenance mode](http://help.cloud66.com/managing-your-stack/stack-network-settings#maintenance) to prevent it from serving content. We highly recommend that you build a stack with similar server specifications to your main stack to avoid issues during a switch.
