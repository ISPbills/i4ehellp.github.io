To add SSL to your stack, you need to have a SSL certificate and key. Some certificate authorities also provide you with an intermediate certificate. Firstly, please make sure that your SSL keys don't have any passphrases.

Once you have your certificate, key and possibly intermediate certificate, paste them into the appropriate boxes of the [SSL certificate add-in](http://help.cloud66.com/stack-add-ins/ssl-certificate). You can also add the domain name if you want to limit the SSL to a certain domain.
