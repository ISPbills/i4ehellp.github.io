### 6. Set up a replication between two stacks

On stack `B` go on stack page/database server (Redis, MySQL or etc.) and choose the server. On the right side bar click on "configure replication" choose stack A (you have to be Administrator on stack A otherwise it won't be listed). This makes stack B databases slave for stack `A`.
