## Resolution 1: Configuring the gem

Many gems allow the use of a configuration file, or have initializers to configure them, so these can be used to set the directory needed for deployment. This will vary depending on the gem that is causing your issue - we recommend that you have a look at the documentation provided by your gem to see if an alternative configuration is indeed possible.
