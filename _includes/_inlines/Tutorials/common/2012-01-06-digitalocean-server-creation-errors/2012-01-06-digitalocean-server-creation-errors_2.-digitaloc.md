### 2. DigitalOcean have limited new server creation

DigitalOcean may have suspended the creation of your particular server size in your chosen datacenter. This happens periodically as a way for DigitalOcean to manage their growth and prevent over-subscription of particular sizes in particular regions. 
User's should be able to validate whether or not their server can be created by attempting to create the corresponding server manually via the DigitalOcean UI. 

If the chosen size/datacenter remains unavailable for an extended period of time, it is suggested that an alternative size or datacenter is used.
