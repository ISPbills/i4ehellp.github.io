## “HTTP Error 401” or “HTTP Error 403”

This error indicates that your credentials are no-longer correct for your API account. When you initially enter your DigitalOcean API credentials into Cloud 66 we validate that those credentials are correct. However, it is possible that your credentials have been altered on the DigitalOcean side (either by the user, a memeber of their team or in some cases by DigitalOcean themselves)

The resolution for this error is to update your DigitalOcean Cloud API credentials via the Cloud 66 UI.
