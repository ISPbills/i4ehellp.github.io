## Amazon Elastic Load Balancer

To register an SSL certificate with Amazon Elastic Load Balancer, please refer to our [blog post](http://blog.cloud66.com/registering-ssl-certificate-with-amazon-elastic-load/).

Thanks to the AWS dashboard or the command line interface, you can easily upload your SSL certificates to relevant load balancers.

Through the AWS dashboard:

*   Sign in to the AWS management console and open the Amazon EC2 console.
*   Select your load balancer and upload a new SSL Certificate or choose an existing one.
*   In case it is a new certificate, enter a name for the certificate and copy paste the contents of the private key file and the public key file into the related fields, then save.
