## What server size do I need?

Using Heroku, you can choose between 1X (512 MB), 2X (1 GB) and PX (6 GB) server sizes. This makes it easy to calculate your server requirements, and we recommend that you use similar server resources when deploying your stack with Cloud 66. We also recommend that you have a seperate server for your database in production environments.
