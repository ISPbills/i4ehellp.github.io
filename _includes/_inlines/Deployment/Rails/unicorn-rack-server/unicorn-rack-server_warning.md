### Warning

Please ensure to follow the conventions set out in the configuration below if you are having issues, and that you are using an up-to-date version of Unicorn.




Here is a **unicorn.rb** configuration file that is compatible with Cloud 66 requirements (following the Procfile line above, this should be located under the `config` folder of your Rails app):

{% highlight ruby %}
worker_processes 2

working_directory "#{ENV['STACK_PATH']}"

listen "/tmp/web_server.sock", :backlog => 64

timeout 30

pid '/tmp/web_server.pid'

stderr_path "#{ENV['STACK_PATH']}/log/unicorn.stderr.log"
stdout_path "#{ENV['STACK_PATH']}/log/unicorn.stdout.log"

preload_app true
GC.respond_to?(:copy_on_write_friendly=) and
	GC.copy_on_write_friendly = true

check_client_connection false

before_fork do |server, worker|
	old_pid = '/tmp/web_server.pid.oldbin'
	if File.exists?(old_pid) && server.pid != old_pid
		begin
			Process.kill("QUIT", File.read(old_pid).to_i)
		rescue Errno::ENOENT, Errno::ESRCH
			# someone else did our job for us
		end
	end

	defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
		ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
	defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
		ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
end
{% endhighlight %}
