## Deploy with Passenger Enterprise

We require two simple steps to deploy with Passenger Enterprise:

1. Place your `passenger-enterprise-license` file into your .cloud66 folder, which in turn is located in the root of your repository.

2. Add a `PASSENGER_ENTERPRISE_DOWNLOAD_TOKEN` [environment variable](/deployment/environment-variables) which contains the value of your Passenger Enterprise download token.

If both these conditions are met, any Passenger-based server is deployed with the Enterprise edition installed. Ensure that Passenger Enterprise is displayed in the _About your app_ section of your analysis before deploying.
