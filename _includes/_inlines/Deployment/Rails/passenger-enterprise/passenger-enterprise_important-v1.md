## Important

We recommend that you choose Passenger Enterprise as your web server at the time of initial build of the stack. If you already have a stack, please [scale up](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/stack-management/scaling.html) to a new application server and scale down the old one to add Passenger Enterprise.
