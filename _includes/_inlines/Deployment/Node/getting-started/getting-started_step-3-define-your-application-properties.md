## Step 3: Define your application properties

Complete the following steps to define the properties Cloud 66 uses to identify your application.

**Prerequisites**  

You must know the URL for your Git repository and the associated Git branch. For instructions on retrieving the Git repo URL and how to format it for this procedure, refer to [Access a public Git repository](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/accessing-your-git-repository#public) or [Access a private Git repository](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/accessing-your-git-repository#private).

1.  In the _About your app_ dialog box, do the following actions:
*   In the _Your Git Repo URL_ box, enter the URL for your Git repository.
*   In the _Git branch_ box, type the branch name. This field defaults to the "master" branch.
*   In the _Give your stack a name_ box, type a name for your application stack.
*   In the _Environment_ list, select the environment to deploy.
2.  Click _Analyze_. Cloud 66 will analyze your application.
