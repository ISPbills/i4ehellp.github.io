## About using DigitalOcean cloud

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any [DigitalOcean region](http://developers.cloud66.com/#cloud-vendor-instance-regions). Private networking is enabled for all data centers that support it. This means that servers can communicate freely between each other on the same network without counting towards bandwidth costs.
