## Cloud Lockdown

For larger organisations with multiple cloud keys and multiple departments requiring access to different cloud keys, we now allow deployment "targets" to be locked down at a user permission level for all users in your team. 

From the Account -> Teams menu, you can edit permissions for any user; specifically now you can "Restrict deployment targets" to a list of deployment targets (including "Registered Servers")
