## Overview

Sometimes you need to run multiple applications on the same stack. This could be because none of those applications has enough traffic to justify having a dedicated stack for itself or it could be because all the apps on the stack share many resources. What ever the reason, you can achieve multi-tenancy for your stacks with Cloud 66 for Docker.
