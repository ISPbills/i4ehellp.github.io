## Using EasyDeploy repositories

You can see the repositories that we currently support from the [EasyDeploy App Store](https://app.cloud66.com/easydeploys). Please contact us on [hello@cloud66.com](mailto:hello@cloud66.com) if you would like to add your project to this list.

Remember to check the repository documentation for possible login credentials and environment variables. If you forget to set environment
variables during your first deploy, you can always set or change them at a later stage.
