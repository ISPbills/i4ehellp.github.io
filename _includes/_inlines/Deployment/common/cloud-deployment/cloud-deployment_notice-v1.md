Should you wish to delete your stack on Cloud 66, your servers **will not** be deleted on your cloud provider unless [physical server deletion](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/stack-management/server-deletion.html) is turned on.

If you don't want to use a cloud provider with Cloud 66, you can [deploy to your own server](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/deployment/registered-servers.html).
