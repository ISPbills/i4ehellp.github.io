### Build root

Specifies the directory of your repository in which you wish to run your Docker build. You can also specify a [Dockerfile path](https://help.cloud66.works/skycap/deployment/building-your-service.html#dockerfile_path), which will be the Dockerfile used when building your service which is a relative value to this one.



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/building-your-service/code_building-your-service_build-root-rvices-v1.md  product = include.product %}




This will default to the _root folder_ of your repository if not specified.
