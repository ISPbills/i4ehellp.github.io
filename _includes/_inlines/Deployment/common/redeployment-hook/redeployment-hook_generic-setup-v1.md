### Generic Setup

Most Git providers have a commit hook mechanism that you can use to post to the Cloud 66 redeployment hook URL. Please check your Git provider documentation for this information. If your Git provider has a non-conforming payload format (not compatible with Github or BitBucket formats) then please get in touch and we can extend our payload support!
