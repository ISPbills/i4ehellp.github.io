## Specify environment variables

You can add your environment variables to your manifest files.

Here is an example:



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/building-a-manifest-file/code_building-a-manifest-file_specify-environment-variables-v1.md  product = include.product %}




If you need to auto generate a value, you can use the `AUTO_GENERATE` keyword. It generates a 10 character long random string unless you specify the length after it: `AUTO_GENERATE_15` which generates a 15 character random string.

Environment variables set in your manifest file will only apply during the initial build of your stack. Please refer to our documentation on [environment variables](https://help.cloud66.com/{{ include.product }}/deployment/env-vars.html) if you'd like to set them beyond this point.

Any environment variable that is generated by the result of the code analysis (like database addresses) will override any value specified in the manifest file. In other words, you cannot specify a value like `MYSQL_ADDRESS` in your manifest file as it will be ignored.
