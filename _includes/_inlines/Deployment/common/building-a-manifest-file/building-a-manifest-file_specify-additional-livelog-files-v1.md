## Specify additional LiveLog files

Each application type supports the additional partial configuration to add custom live log files for that application type:



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/building-a-manifest-file/code_building-a-manifest-file_specify-additional-livelog-fi-v1.md  product = include.product %}




For more information about **LiveLogs** and additional examples, please see the [LiveLogs help page](http://help.cloud66.com/{{ include.product }}/stack-management/live-logs.html).
