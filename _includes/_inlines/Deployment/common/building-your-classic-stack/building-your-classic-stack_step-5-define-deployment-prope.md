## Step 5: Define deployment properties

Complete the following steps to define the properties that determine how to deploy your application.

**Prerequisites**  

If deploying to a cloud server, you must know the API key for your cloud provider. If deploying to your server, you must have (or generate) a SSH key for the server. For instructions on generating an SSH key, refer to [Setting up SSH keys](http://community.cloud66.com/articles/setting-up-ssh-keys).

1.  In the _Where are you deploying to_ dialog box, select the deployment target to use.
2.  Perform one of the following actions, depending on your deployment configuration:
    *   If deploying to a cloud, select the cloud provider, server region and server size.
    *   If deploying to a server, enter your username and IP address.
3.  In the _Deployment details_ dialog box, select the database option to use.
4.  Click _Deploy_.
