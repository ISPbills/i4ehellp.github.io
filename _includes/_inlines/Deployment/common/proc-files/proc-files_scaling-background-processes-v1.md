## Scaling background processes

You can scale your background processes up and down on the process server page. On your stack detail page, click the link to your _Process server_ group on your stack detail page. Use the _+_ and _-_ buttons to scale your processes up and down.

You can also scale up a [standalone process server](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/stack-management/scaling.html) for more resources.
