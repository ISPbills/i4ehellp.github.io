## About using Rackspace cloud

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any Rackspace [region](http://developers.cloud66.com/#cloud-vendor-instance-regions#rackspace). Note that if you hold a Rackspace UK account, you will be limited to creating servers in the London region. The Rackspace US account is able to create servers in the remaining regions.
