## Generate a Rackspace API key

You need to provide your Rackspace API key in order for Cloud 66 to access your account. To generate a key, access the _Account_ dropdown in the top right of your Rackspace account, and go to the _User Management_ page. Once there, click _Create a new user_, and fill in the necessary details for this new user. This user must be created with **Full Access** in order for servers to be created in your account.

Once you click _Create user_, you will be able to view the API Key by clicking _Show_.
