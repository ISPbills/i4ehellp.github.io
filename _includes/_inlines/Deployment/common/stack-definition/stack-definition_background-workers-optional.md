### Background workers (optional)

To relieve pressure from your application, we recommend that you use background workers to run memory-intensive processes. Cloud 66 makes it easy for you to [control and monitor these processes](/deployment/running-background-processes), as well as [scale them](/managing-your-stack/scaling) at the click of a button.
