## Clone a stack

There are various reasons for cloning an existing stack - for example, you may want to deploy a production environment of an existing development stack, or migrate across regions or data centers.

To clone a stack, visit your stack page and click _Clone this stack_ from the right sidebar. This will allow you to choose a new stack name and environment. Cloning your stack will preserve any environment variables from the existing stack, and also allows you to define where to deploy to along with other settings.
