## About deployment gateways

If you want to deploy your stack in a DMZ, you should prepare a bastion server which enables you to connect to your DMZ. You should define a **Deployment Gateway** in your Cloud66 account and specify the information of the bastion server, then you will be able to deploy your stack in the DMZ.
