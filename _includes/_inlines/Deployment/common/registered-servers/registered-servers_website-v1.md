### Website

Visit the [_Registered Servers_](https://app.cloud66.com/registered_servers) page on Cloud 66, which will provide with you a shell script to run on your server - you can download it to inspect it first.

Once the shell script has successfully completed, the server will now show up in the **New Servers** list for you to approve. Once it is approved, it will be available for you to use on any stack!
