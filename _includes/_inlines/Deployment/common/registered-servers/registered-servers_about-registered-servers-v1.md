## About registered servers

Registered servers are a great way for operations teams to manage and allocate physical server resources for consumption by dev teams. Registered servers are essentially a pool of your own servers on a private or public cloud that can be used on any stack and configuration. Stacks can be deployed across a hybrid of cloud and registered servers - in this way you could have a dedicated server for your database and burst cloud servers for your front end.
