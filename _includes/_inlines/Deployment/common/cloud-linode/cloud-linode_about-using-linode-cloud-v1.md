## About using Linode cloud

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any [Linode region](http://developers.cloud66.com/#cloud-vendor-instance-regions#linode). Private networking is automatically enabled for all servers deployed by Cloud 66. This means that servers can communicate freely between each other on the same network without counting towards bandwidth costs.
