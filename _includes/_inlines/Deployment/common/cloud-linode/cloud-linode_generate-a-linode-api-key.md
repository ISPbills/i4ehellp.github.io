## Generate a Linode API key

You need to provide your Linode API keys in order for Cloud 66 to access your account. To generate one, access the _my profile_ page of your Linode account, and go to the _API Keys_ menu (you may be asked to provide your password again for security reasons). Once there, create a label for your new key, as well as an expiry date, and then hit _Create API Key_. Take note of the key provided.
