## Using environment variables

- **Bash scripts**



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/env-vars/code_env-vars_using-environment-variables-code.md %}




- **.YML files**  



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/env-vars/code_env-vars_using-environment-variables-rnamelt.md %}




- **.RB files**  



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/env-vars/code_env-vars_using-environment-variables-kingdirector.md %}
