## Shortcuts

Toolbelt has some useful shortcuts to help speed up your workflow.

## Running cx in a git directory

To make life easier for you, the Cloud 66 toolbelt **detects the Git URL and branch for each directory it is run in**. As such, you won’t have to specify which application you want to run the toolbelt on if you’re in the git folder and branch of one of your applications.

## Naming shortcuts

We apply naming shortcuts to both application and server names, as well as server roles in the toolbelt, so you don’t have to type their full names. We just need you to type enough of a name for it to be unique. 

For example, if you only have one application that starts with *m*, you can simply type *m*. Similarly, if you only have one web server, you can type *w* instead of *web*
