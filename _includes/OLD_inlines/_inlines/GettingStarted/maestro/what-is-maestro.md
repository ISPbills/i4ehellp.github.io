## What is Maestro?

Maestro is a full stack Application Management service. It takes care of building your infrastructure (servers, load balancers, etc) for you on your own servers in the cloud. It also manages deployment and maintenance of your entire stack. Maestro can be seamlessly integrated with Skycap and use the images built by Skycap to deploy your application in any environment.
