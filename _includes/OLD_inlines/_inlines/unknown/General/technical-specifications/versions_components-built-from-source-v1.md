### Components built from source

Cloud 66 maintains an internal list of versions for most components built from source, which is updated periodically after testing.

You are free to specify a version for a number of components in your [manifest file](https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/deployment/getting-started-with-manifest-files.html).
