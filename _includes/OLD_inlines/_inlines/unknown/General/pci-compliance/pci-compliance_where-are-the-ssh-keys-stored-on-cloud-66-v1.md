### Where are the SSH keys stored on Cloud 66?
The SSH keys are stored on an isolated storage in Cloud 66 network. The keys are encrypted with a key and are only readable using the secure key.

The encryption keys are provided to our production servers during the startup and are not stored anywhere on our production gateways.
