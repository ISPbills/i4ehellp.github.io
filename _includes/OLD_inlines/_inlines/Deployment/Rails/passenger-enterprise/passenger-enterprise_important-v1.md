## Important

We recommend that you choose Passenger Enterprise as your web server at the time of initial build of the stack. If you already have a stack, please [scale up]({% if include.product == "skycap" %}https://help.cloud66.works/maestro/stack-management/scaling.html{% else %}https://help.cloud66.works/{{ include.product }}/stack-management/scaling.html{% endif %}) to a new application server and scale down the old one to add Passenger Enterprise.
