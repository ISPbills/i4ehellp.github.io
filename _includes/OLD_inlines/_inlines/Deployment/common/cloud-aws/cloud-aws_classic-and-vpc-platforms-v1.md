### Classic and VPC platforms

You can choose to create servers in both the [Classic and VPC platforms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html). To use a VPC, your account must conform with the [default VPC guidelines](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html#launching-into). 

Certain instances types, such as the T2, require the use of VPC.
