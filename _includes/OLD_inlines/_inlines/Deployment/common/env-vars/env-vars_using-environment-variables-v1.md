## Using environment variables

Using environment variables is done differently depending on your application settings, but these are some examples.

- **Bash scripts**



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/env-vars/code_env-vars_using-environment-variables-code-v1.md  product = include.product %}




- **.YML files**  



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/env-vars/code_env-vars_using-environment-variables-rnamelt-v1.md  product = include.product %}




- **.RB files**  



{%include _inlines/Deployment/common/env-vars/code_env-vars_using-environment-variables-kingdirector-v1.md  product = include.product %}
