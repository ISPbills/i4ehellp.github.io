### What is InfluxDB?
[InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/) is an open source Time-Series database, and it's easy to add to your stack as an add-in.






## Add InfluxDB
To add InfluxDB to your stack, access the add-ins menu, click _InfluxDB_ and choose the size of your new server.









### Note

For docker stacks this will be added to the host not as a container.
